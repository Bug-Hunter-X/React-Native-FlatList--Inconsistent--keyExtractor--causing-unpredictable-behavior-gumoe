This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and providing an invalid or inconsistent `keyExtractor` function.  The `keyExtractor` function is crucial for FlatList to efficiently update and render its items.  If it returns the same key for different items, or if it doesn't return a unique key for each item, FlatList can behave unpredictably, leading to incorrect rendering, unexpected behavior, and potential crashes. For example, using the index as a key (e.g., `keyExtractor={(item, index) => index}`) is generally discouraged because the keys may become invalid upon data mutation, such as inserting or removing elements.  This approach might not generate a clear error message, leading to difficulty debugging.
